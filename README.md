## News
[2025.03.05] Our paper has been accepted at IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging! ðŸŽ‰

## Quick start
### 1. Conda Env Preparation
To build a compatible conda env, you only need to run the following lines one by one:

```bash
conda create -n aicg python=3.10
conda activate aicg
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -U openmim
cd mmpose_package/mmpose
pip install -e .
mim install mmengine
mim install "mmcv>=2.0.0"
pip install --upgrade numpy
```

### 2. Test
Test with the pretrained weights:
```bash
python test_and_visualize.py --config 'configs/your_config_file' --checkpoint 'path_to_your_checkpoint'
```
